    <h2><a href="panacakes.html">Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes!</a></h2>
    <p>Despite one of my lovely children likening eating my pancakes to choking down roadkill this morning, I got cajoled by the other child into making pancakes this morning. (Note: the child that said they have to shove them down and hope they don’t vomit ate two of them without complaint faster than I could cook the rest of the batch.) The ironic part is that I chose the cooktop I have heavily based on the fact that I wanted to be able to use a griddle on it so I wanted burners with symmetrical output so that I wouldn’t have to fuck with the heat too much to get it be even.  Jokes on me I guess.</p>
</figure>
<p><img src="pancakes_before_the_fall.jpg" alt="two chocolate chip pancakes on a griddle" /></p>
</figure>
<p>I like buttermilk pancakes best, but I don’t think my kids really notice or give a shit. It’s the thought that counts? I’ll actually give you amounts here because I’m feeling generous this morning, but like when I measure this out nothing is really that precise because it sort of doesn’t matter.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 cups all purpose flour (this might be the only time i don’t bother weighing it)</li>
<li>1.5 tsp baking soda</li>
<li>.5 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>.5 tsp salt</li>
<li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
<li>2 eggs</li>
<li>4 tbps melted and cooled butter</li>
<li>1 tbsp vanilla extract</li>
<li>2.5 cups buttermilk</li>
</ul>
<p>If you use not-buttermilk, you should only use 2 cups, and switch the amounts of the baking soda and baking powder. When you cook them, ensure you’ve got even heat on your cooking surface and wipe it down with some oil. And by wipe it down I mean add a small amount of oil (or as my friends in TN say “erl”) when the surface is hot and then get at it with a towel. You want the surface to be shiny, but you don’t really want to see any oil at all.  Then ladle some out, wait for bubbles, flip and OMG IF YOU DON’T WAIT LONG ENOUGH IT’LL BECOME THE AMOEBA THAT ATE CHICAGO. Whatever my kids can’t even cut their own pancakes up so I have to cut them up for them before I give them to them so they could be shaped like raised middle fingers and they wouldn’t even notice.</p>

    <h2><a href="tater-salad.html">Potato Salad</a></h2>
    <p>I mean potato salad is sort of like one of those things that you don’t really use a recipe for in my mind? It’s potatoes, boiled, cooled and like mayo essentially. Tonight’s was a hard boiled egg, some red onion, celery, carrot and bread &amp; butter pickles diced up and the eponymous potatoes.</p>
<p>In my mind the potatoes should be skin-on, cut into chunks (I used small red onions, so like quartered?) and then boiled in water with a good amount of salt and apple cider vinegar.  The vinegar will keep the pectins intact so the potatoes don’t fall apart. Drain them when they’re soft and spread them out on a sheet pan and sprinkle them with a little bit more salt and vinegar. As the potatoes cool they’ll contract and some of that will get sucked inside.</p>
<p>The dressing tonight was celery seed, mayo, sour cream, apple cider vinegar, dijon mustard, pickle brine, salt and pepper.  As usual I made too much  you don’t want to drown the potatoes in it. Sometimes it’s mostly yogurt. Sometimes it’s all mayo. Sometimes there’s some fucking crème fraîche in it. Or like do it like the Germans do with bacon and a vinaigrette. But that’s probably a different blog post.</p>
<p>I also heated up some veggie burgers from Costco. They taste like tumeric in a weird way, but, whatever, one of my kids will eat it. The other one pretends like they’re being gagged with a spoon or being waterboarded so they got to eat a slice of cheese in a bun.</p>

    <h2><a href="chicken-sofrito.html">Chicken Sofrito & Charred Eggplant</a></h2>
    <p>This recipe caught my eye the other day when I was perusing cookbooks to try and figure out what to make for dinner this week: Chicken Sofrito, but like, not? I know sofrito as like the sautéed veggie base in Latinx/Spanish cooking, but like the name of this book is Jerusalem. (Although, the heavy Mediterranean influence on the food of the Levant, coupled with the fact the Muslims ruled Spain for a real long time, and like I can kind of see the cross-cultural influences of Spanish/Middle Eastern/North African cooking…)</p>
<p>ANYWAY, apparently in Israeli cooking (maybe more than Israeli cooking?) sofrito means that you’re cooking meat with a very small amount of fat/liquid. The world is a magical place friends.</p>
<p>The recipe was pretty simple: I removed the backbone from a small chicken (the smallest one I could find was 4.5lbs), and then removed the keel bone from it. You could probably just buy like a halved chicken or thighs or something, but like, a whole chicken is so much cheaper and you get the backbone to freeze and eat like an ice pop! (Mmmmmmm salmonella!) I then slowly browned it in my dutch oven over medium heat with some canola oil until it had gotten a nice toasty brown and most of the fat had rendered out from the skin.  I took it out, added a quartered onion, and put the chicken back on, skin side up, rubbed down with some tumeric, paprika, salt, lemon juice and a tiny bit of sugar. Then the lid went on, the heat went to the very lowest my range would go and I went back to work.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="chicken_sofrito_chicken.jpg" alt="a chicken, in a pot, with onion beneath it" /></p>
</figure>
<p>After it had been in there for a bit I peeled and cubed up like 2 lbs of yukon gold potatoes. Probably too many potatoes, but like my last name is Kennedy so saying too many potatoes is the kind of thing that would make my grandfather rise from the grave and try to sand me to death with his scratch-ass 5 o’clock shadow.  I also got like a head of garlic separated.  The recipe said not to peel it, but they’re fucking wrong, so like, peel that fucking garlic or your partner will be pulling fried and braised (spoiler alert?) garlic skin from their mouth and asking you what the fuck is wrong with what you cooked. But like I said, fry the potatoes and garlic until they get some color on them.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="chicken_sofrito_frying.jpg" alt="garlic frying in a wok" /></p>
</figure>
<p>Like many things in the kitchen, Kenji Lopez-Alt is right about frying in a wok. It’s the only way to go.  There was no splatter to clean up, unlike last night’s katzu, which I did in a cast iron pan like a chump. Don’t be like me. Be smart.</p>
<p>After the garlic and potatoes were fried, I took the chicken out, put in the garlic and potatoes, and then the chicken back on, and then the lid and then let it slowly cook for another 30 minutes or so.</p>
<p>Meanwhile I cut some small skinny eggplants (these were Chinese according to the supermarket, but maybe they’re Italian? Or Japanese?) into thirds, and salted them decently and let them sit for 30 minutes. Then rinsed off the salt and pressed them dry on some kitchen towels. Then rubbed them with olive oil and put them under the broiler until they were black and charred.  A little lemon juice, tahini, parsley and Aleppo chili powder sprinkled on top for fun.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="chicken_sofrito_eggplant.jpg" alt="eggplant with tahini, lemon juice, parsley and aleppo chili" /></p>
</figure>
<p>When those were done (they were served at room temp), I pulled the chicken out of the pan and let it cook and then picked all the meat off the bones because god fucking forbid that anyone in my family realizes that meat comes on bones and I’m fucking done for. Given that I had shredded the meat, I stirred it back into the potato/garlic/onion sauce, and squeezed in another lemon. Then my kids ate a peanut butter and jelly and the other one had toast with jam and yogurt. At least I made the sandwich bread?  Philistines, the whole fucking lot of them.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="chicken_sofrito_done.jpg" alt="chicken sofrito, on a plate" /></p>

<p>Ingredients:</p>
<ul>
<li>a whole fucking chicken</li>
<li>ground tumeric</li>
<li>paprika (smoke ’em if you got ’em)</li>
<li>white sugar (I bet honey would be good here)</li>

    <h2><a href="pork-katzu.html">Tonkatzu (pork cutlets) & a Fennel, Red Onion & Parsley salad</a></h2>
    <p>This is one of my kids favorite meals: thin pounded pork loin, breaded and fried, with rice. They’re not a huge fan of the salad, but you need something to cut through the fat of the katzu and the sweetness of the <a href="http://tonkatsu.bulldog.jp/bulldogsauce/">katzu sauce</a>.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="pork_katzu_done.jpg" alt="Finished pork katzu" /></p>
</figure>
<p>I usually buy an intact loin rather than the boneless chops since it’s cheaper, keeps longer and it’s really pretty easy to divide the loin into four equal pieces, and then butterfly them (or just divide into eight pieces), and then pound them thin. To make that part easier, sprinkle a little water on top of the meat, cover it with plastic wrap, and then sprinkle the smallest amount of water on top of the plastic. Take your meat pounder (lol) and give it some nice even not-too-hard thwacks  when you come down on it, slide the pounder outward to help spread the meat out (lol). This is where the water helps since it makes things a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qI1f5lZRic&amp;list=PLCFA6FF71C4E34E76&amp;index=80">little more slippery</a>. If you need a meat pounder <a href="https://www.cooksillustrated.com/equipment_reviews/2152-meat-pounders">Cook’s Illustrated</a> says the “Norpro Grip EZ Pounder” is the one for you.</p>
<p>Then it’s time to season and bread them. I usually season the meat rather than the breading since it uses way less season and guarantees more even seasoning, but it’s a standard three-way (lol) breading station: flour, egg &amp; milk, panko bread crumbs. Make sure you get the excess bits off in each step and for chrissakes use different hands for wet and dry or you’ll get club hand and frankly that’s your problem to deal with.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="pork_katzu_breading.jpg" alt="A breading station with three bays: flour, egg wash, breadcrumbs" /></p>
</figure>
<p>I usually refridgerate the cutlets for an hour or so before frying them in 360º-375º canola/peanut/safflower/anything-but-olive-oil-honestly. When they’re brown on both sides they’re done. Let ’em drain.</p>
<p>The salad is pretty simple  a head of fennel and a half a red onion, shaved thin. See that brutality of a kitchen implement? Ask me about the 17 stitches I have in my right pinky.  Now ask me about that glove.  It’s cool, I see you’re busy, I’ll wait. The dressing is a a standard 1:2 ratio of rice vinegar and half toasted sesame oil and half canola oil, with some dijon mustard, soy sauce and white miso in there for salt and funk.</p>

    <p>It’s time for weekly meal planning so I can make a shopping list so I can go to the store so we don’t just order in pizza every night.  This week’s menu includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pork Katzu with a Fennel/Apple/Parsley salad</li>
<li>Chicken Sofrito from Yotom Ottolenghi &amp; Sami Tamimi’s <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/jerusalem-a-cookbook/9781607743941">Jerusalem</a> along side Roasted Eggplant with Tahini, inspired by that book.</li>
<li>Veggie Burgers (Frozen! From Costco!) and Potato Salad</li>
<li>Lamb Kabobs &amp; Roasted Cauliflower &amp; Hazelnut salad from <a href="https://bookshop.org/books/jerusalem-a-cookbook/9781607743941">Jerusalem</a> again and homemade pita</li>
<li>Saag Panner (a combination of the NYTimes &amp; America’s Test Kitchen recepies since I like neither by themselves) with roti and saffron rice (oh yeah we’re fucking money up in here. <em>saffron</em>)</li>
<li>Roast Beef, Mashed Potatoes, Corn, Mushroom Gravy, Yorkshire Pudding &amp; Horseradish. I have a friend who says they don’t like mashed potatoes. I’m gonna prove them wrong.</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s enough cooking for a week.  There will be left overs.  I’ll make Julie cook one night.  We’ll be horrible parents and order pizza for the kids and eat outside in the lovely March Seattle weather?</p>
<p>(I don’t make any money from those book links, but my local bookstore will get a cut of the proceeds!)</p>

    <h2><a href="saltine-toffee.html">Saltine Toffee</a></h2>
    <p>Somehow I got roped into making a dessert for our kid’s school’s “dessert dash” for their fundraising auction. I guess when you’re married to a PTA member, you’re unwittingly agreeing to these things, but I digress.  Since I’m lazy I made Saltine Toffee.</p>
<ul>
<li>2 sticks of butter</li>
<li>2 cups of dark brown sugar</li>
<li>1 sleeve of saltines</li>
<li>Chocolate chips</li>
</ul>
<p>Melt the butter and sugar together over low heat until it’s boiling, and let it for a few minutes.  While you’re waiting (and stirring it), grease up a sheet pan (stir the butter and sugar) and cover the bottom with foil (don’t forget to stir the butter and sugar) and then grease the foil (are you still stirring?) and then lay out the saltines in a single layer as close together as you can get them (oh my god are you stirring?!).  When the butter and sugar have boiled for a bit (I dunno, 6 minutes? It’ll be bubbly and stuff), pour it over the saltines and try to spread it out into a thin even layer. You know you can do it.  Or not.  Gravity really is your friend here, unlike all those other times. Throw on a bunch of chocolate chips and let them sit until they’re melty and then spread them on top into a layer.  It ain’t gonna be fucking even so don’t worry about it.  If the chocolate isn’t melting, throw on your broiler and put it under for like 30 seconds. DON’T FUCKING BURN THE CHOCOLATE. Let it cool and then put it in the fridge. Or just put it in the fridge. They’re not my groceries that’ll get ruined.</p>
<p>When it’s totally cool, break it apart. It’ll be ugly like a hairless cat, but like, its sugar, chocolate and butter.</p>

    <h2><a href="black-bean-sweet-potato-chili.html">Black Bean & Sweet Potato Chili</a></h2>
    <p>Some simple “chili”.  Whatever. It’s got:</p>
<ul>
<li>a sweet potato, peeled and roughly cubed</li>
<li>some black beans. i made them earlier. maybe you got some in cans? who cares.</li>
<li>an onion, diced</li>
<li>a few cloves of garlic, smashed and roughly chopped.  i used maybe 6?</li>
<li>a jalapeño (or a poblano or something else hot or more of them or less of them)</li>
<li>a few canned chipotles, chopped</li>
<li>a red bell pepper</li>
<li>chicken stock or water or beer or something wet</li>
<li>some chili powder. i made my own, but you can use whatever you like. mine has cumin, corriander, dried oregano, smoked paprika and some ground, dried chilies (tonight was i think aleppo and kashmiri. look i’m international!)</li>
</ul>
<p>I cooked the onions and peppers and then added everything else and then added liquid until it looked like it was a soup.  Then I cooked it until it got thicker. Actually I totally forgot about it while I wrote the software for this blog. Then Julie was all “where’s dinner” and I was all “oh yeah, well it’s done”.</p>
<p>We ate it with some cheese and avocado and scallions and sour cream and chips.</p>

    <h2><a href="welcome-i-guess.html">Welcome to whatever I'm cooking.</a></h2>
    <p>Hi. I’m Todd. I make dinner for my family almost every night. Here are many of the things I cook. Sometimes they’re from recipes, sometimes they’re not. Sometimes you get the amount of an ingredient, but most of the time it’s just “all of it” or “however much you like in what you’re eating.” If something cannot be omitted or substituted it means it’s probably in the name of the recipe, but like, idk, if you want to use something else go for it. Don’t like cilantro? Leave it out. Maybe you like parsley instead? Sure add that  you’re the one who is eating it</p>

    <h2><a href="broccoli-tofu.html">Broccoli & Tofu, Scallion Pancakes, rice</a></h2>
    <p>Tonight’s dinner was Broccoli &amp; Tofu with rice and some scallion pancakes. The pancakes are mix-up of <a href="https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/extra-flaky-scallion-pancakes-recipe.html">The Flakiest Scallion Pancakes</a> from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (the dough &amp; double roll technique) and Alton Brown’s <a href="https://altonbrown.com/recipes/scallion-pancakes/">Scallion Pancakes</a> (the scallion oil).</p>
<p>The Broccoli &amp; Tofu was from nowhere specifically; the sauce was black vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, corn starch, water, shaoxing cooking wine and sugar. I cut the tofu in half and let it sit wrapped in a kitchen towel in the fridge with some weight on it to get it drier. Then I lightly dusted it with cornstarch, and cooked it in the wok first, getting it crispy-ish.  Then I took it out, added the broccoli and ilet it get some color. Then added some ginger, garlic and onions.  Then poured in the sauce, and added the tofu back.  Then we ate.</p>
