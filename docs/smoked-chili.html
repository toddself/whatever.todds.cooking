<p>You know I tried to smoke tomatillos yesterday, but I couldn’t like the joint because they were so wet? I’ll never figure out how someone can even light a brisket.</p>
<p>Oh god is this post just going to be filled with lame attempts at weed jokes?</p>
<p>Don’t you fucking know it!</p>
<p>I think my favorite part about cooking food, as you all might have observed, is how excited my kids are when I present them with something that they haven’t really tried before. They’re so adventurous it’s awesome to watch them try their first oyster or that time they ate stinky tofu.</p>
<p>Wait. Sorry. I’m high AF right now.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="chili_smoking.jpg" alt="veggies on a grill" /></p>
<figcaption>the smell of these burning green things...</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I put this chili on the table and my youngest sits down and makes a face that I can only describe as horrifying, like I had cooked our cat and served it’s head atop their plate. Dinner went downhill from there where they only wanted to really suck on a lime. Yes. A lime. I spend several hours in the kitchen making a huge pot of chili and this fucking kid is all “OH THIS LIME IS GREAT DAD THANKS. I PUT SOME LIME ON MY CHEESE AND NOW I DON’T WANT MY CHEESE BUT I WANT TO SUCK THE LIFE OUT OF THIS LIME.”</p>
<p>A GODDAMN LIME.</p>
<p>NOT EVEN LIKE A RIPE LIME BECAUSE I LIVE IN SEATTLE WHERE LIMES DO NOT GROW (despite the fact we had a tiny lime tree that fruited but then died).</p>
<p>THEY DIDN’T EVEN PUT IN A COCONUT NOR DID THEY SHAKE IT ALL UP.</p>
<figure>
<p><img src="chili_blender.jpg" alt="A blender full of green liquid" /></p>
<figcaption>six days late here bud</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It didn’t start this way though. I had the luck of a stretch of sun so I fired up the charcoal grill with a half-chimney of charcoal, roasted a few poblanos and then threw on a tray of tomatillos and onions to be smoked with some apple wood chips. Since I wasn’t going for anything long or slow I didn’t worry about the heat in the grill, and I didn’t soak the wood (but you shouldn’t ever soak wood for smoking), and just let them go with a handful of chips for about 40 minutes. I’m making smoke-y chili here, not trying to give these onions emphysema.</p>
<p>After I rubbed the charred skin off the poblanos (don’t do this under running water — you’ll wash away a lot of the flavor of the pepper), I threw them, the tomatillos, the onion, a fistful (who says I don’t give you measurements here!) of cilantro (stems included), and a pint of <a href="https://www.stoupbrewing.com/ontap/">Mixtape Romeo</a> from the local brewery and gave it a buzz in the blender until it was fully mixed.</p>
<p>While all the smoking was happening, I trimmed up a decently sized pork shoulder roast, removing some excess fat and breaking it down into more manageable chunks. (In this case, that was four. Four chunks. Four chunks o’ pork.) I salted it and let it rest while I handled the peppers. Once the sauce was ready I rendered some of the fat I had trimmed off the roast and seared all four chunks until they were golden and crusty, and then added the sauce, pork and a cup or so of water and brought it to a boil. Then into a 300º oven for four or five hours, covered, stirring occasionally.</p>

<p><img src="chili_bowl.jpg" alt="a bowl of chili" /></p>
<figcaption>not pictured: the first bowl of chili i ate</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>When the pork was fall-apart tender, I took it out, let it rest until I could touch it, shredded it and stirred it back in along with a metric fuck-ton (sorry for you imperial units people that’s a fortnight of drams) of pinto beans I had cooked last month and frozen.</p>
<p>I gotta say I almost never talk about how good things are on this blog since like, I dunno, I cooked it so I’m a pretty partial judge here, but fuck this was delicious.</p>
