## Dinners for the Week of March 22

It's time for weekly meal planning so I can make a shopping list so I can go to the store so we don't just order in pizza every night.  This week's menu includes:

* Pork Katzu with a Fennel/Apple/Parsley salad
* Chicken Sofrito from Yotom Ottolenghi & Sami Tamimi's [Jerusalem](https://bookshop.org/books/jerusalem-a-cookbook/9781607743941) along side Roasted Eggplant with Tahini, inspired by that book.
* Veggie Burgers (Frozen! From Costco!) and Potato Salad
* Lamb Kabobs & Roasted Cauliflower & Hazelnut salad from [Jerusalem](https://bookshop.org/books/jerusalem-a-cookbook/9781607743941) again and homemade pita
* Saag Panner (a combination of the NYTimes & America's Test Kitchen recepies since I like neither by themselves) with roti and saffron rice (oh yeah we're fucking money up in here. _saffron_)
* Roast Beef, Mashed Potatoes, Corn, Mushroom Gravy, Yorkshire Pudding & Horseradish. I have a friend who says they don't like mashed potatoes. I'm gonna prove them wrong.

That's enough cooking for a week.  There will be left overs.  I'll make Julie cook one night.  We'll be horrible parents and order pizza for the kids and eat outside in the lovely March Seattle weather?

(I don't make any money from those book links, but my local bookstore will get a cut of the proceeds!)
