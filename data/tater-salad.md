## Potato Salad

I mean potato salad is sort of like one of those things that you don't really use a recipe for in my mind? It's potatoes, boiled, cooled and like mayo essentially. Tonight's was a hard boiled egg, some red onion, celery, carrot and bread & butter pickles diced up and the eponymous potatoes.

In my mind the potatoes should be skin-on, cut into chunks (I used small red onions, so like quartered?) and then boiled in water with a good amount of salt and apple cider vinegar.  The vinegar will keep the pectins intact so the potatoes don't fall apart. Drain them when they're soft and spread them out on a sheet pan and sprinkle them with a little bit more salt and vinegar. As the potatoes cool they'll contract and some of that will get sucked inside.

The dressing tonight was celery seed, mayo, sour cream, apple cider vinegar, dijon mustard, pickle brine, salt and pepper.  As usual I made too much &#151; you don't want to drown the potatoes in it. Sometimes it's mostly yogurt. Sometimes it's all mayo. Sometimes there's some fucking crème fraîche in it. Or like do it like the Germans do with bacon and a vinaigrette. But that's probably a different blog post.

I also heated up some veggie burgers from Costco. They taste like tumeric in a weird way, but, whatever, one of my kids will eat it. The other one pretends like they're being gagged with a spoon or being waterboarded so they got to eat a slice of cheese in a bun.
