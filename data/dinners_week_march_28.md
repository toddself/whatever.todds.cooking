## Dinners for the Week of March 29

In rotation this week:

* Ground meat chili with beans
* Pan pizzas and a salad. Not deep dish, but like remember when you were a kid and you'd go to Pizza Hut and they had those tall blue plastic cups and the red and white checkered plastic tablecloths? No? Me neither. My mom would sometimes _order in_ from the Hut, but like going out to dinner was way too rich for us.
* Grilled Swordfish with Iceberg Wedge Salads.
* Peppers stuffed with rice, chickpeas, spinach and chorizo. So fucking continental.
* And I'm certainly not religious in any sense of the word, but goddamn it I love a good ham. So we're having ham. And I'll make challah even though it's chametz, but like, I'm making ham, so...
*
