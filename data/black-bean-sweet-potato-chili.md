## Black Bean & Sweet Potato Chili

Some simple "chili".  Whatever. It's got:
* a sweet potato, peeled and roughly cubed
* some black beans. i made them earlier. maybe you got some in cans? who cares.
* an onion, diced
* a few cloves of garlic, smashed and roughly chopped.  i used maybe 6?
* a jalape√±o (or a poblano or something else hot or more of them or less of them)
* a few canned chipotles, chopped
* a red bell pepper
* chicken stock or water or beer or something wet
* some chili powder. i made my own, but you can use whatever you like. mine has cumin, corriander, dried oregano, smoked paprika and some ground, dried chilies (tonight was i think aleppo and kashmiri. look i'm international!)

I cooked the onions and peppers and then added everything else and then added liquid until it looked like it was a soup.  Then I cooked it until it got thicker. Actually I totally forgot about it while I wrote the software for this blog. Then Julie was all "where's dinner" and I was all "oh yeah, well it's done".

We ate it with some cheese and avocado and scallions and sour cream and chips.
