## Welcome to whatever I'm cooking.

Hi. I'm Todd. I make dinner for my family almost every night. Here are many of the things I cook. Sometimes they're from recipes, sometimes they're not. Sometimes you get the amount of an ingredient, but most of the time it's just "all of it" or "however much you like in what you're eating." If something cannot be omitted or substituted it means it's probably in the name of the recipe, but like, idk, if you want to use something else go for it. Don't like cilantro? Leave it out. Maybe you like parsley instead? Sure add that &#151; you're the one who is eating it
