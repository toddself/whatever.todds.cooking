title: Dinners for the Week of April 19
---

This was a busy weekend in blog-land but ideally you won't notice a single difference! I re-wrote the software that I use to generate this blog and finally got it back to working in this new language. (If you're at all curious, the software and the raw data for the blog are linked at the bottom of every page.) So I guess if any of you four readers of this blog if you see something funky, let me know?

The kids are also back in school and I'm not lying prostrate on the couch watching endless Marvel movies, so I'm back on my menu planning and food shopping bullshit again. Which is good since we were mostly running out of food.

This week I hope to cook:

* Grilled Sausage & Broccoli Rabe with Rosemary Potatoes
* One of my kids is making Spaghetti and Meatballs as an apology for the Asparagus Incident last week (rather than punishing them I told them they had to come up with something that would help them understand why I was so upset)
* Shepard's Pie & Glazed Carrots (the good weather as of late will not last sadly)
* Green Chili with Pork
* Mushrooms & Caramelized Onions with Chicken &amp; Spinach

I also made chicken fajitas last night to round off a week of only cooking two meals (which is a pretty suboptimal week to be honest with you), but I'll have to blog about those later.
