title: Pancakes! Pancakes! Pancakes!
---

Despite one of my lovely children likening eating my pancakes to choking down roadkill this morning, I got cajoled by the other child into making pancakes this morning. (Note: the child that said they have to shove them down and hope they don't vomit ate two of them without complaint faster than I could cook the rest of the batch.) The ironic part is that I chose the cooktop I have heavily based on the fact that I wanted to be able to use a griddle on it so I wanted burners with symmetrical output so that I wouldn't have to fuck with the heat too much to get it be even.  Jokes on me I guess.

I like buttermilk pancakes best, but I don't think my kids really notice or give a shit. It's the thought that counts? I'll actually give you amounts here because I'm feeling generous this morning, but like when I measure this out nothing is really that precise because it sort of doesn't matter.

* 2 cups all purpose flour (this might be the only time i don't bother weighing it)
* 1.5 tsp baking soda
* .5 tsp baking powder
* .5 tsp salt
* 1 tbsp sugar
* 2 eggs
* 4 tbps melted and cooled butter
* 1 tbsp vanilla extract
* 2.5 cups buttermilk

If you use not-buttermilk, you should only use 2 cups, and switch the amounts of the baking soda and baking powder. When you cook them, ensure you've got even heat on your cooking surface and wipe it down with some oil. And by wipe it down I mean add a small amount of oil (or as my friends in TN say "erl") when the surface is hot and then get at it with a towel. You want the surface to be shiny, but you don't really want to see any oil at all.  Then ladle some out, wait for bubbles, flip and OMG IF YOU DON'T WAIT LONG ENOUGH IT'LL BECOME THE AMOEBA THAT ATE CHICAGO. Whatever my kids can't even cut their own pancakes up so I have to cut them up for them before I give them to them so they could be shaped like raised middle fingers and they wouldn't even notice.
