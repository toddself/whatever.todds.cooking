## broccoli & tofu, scallion pancakes, rice

Tonight's dinner was Broccoli & Tofu with rice and some scallion pancakes. The pancakes are mix-up of [The Flakiest Scallion Pancakes](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/extra-flaky-scallion-pancakes-recipe.html) from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (the dough & double roll technique) and Alton Brown's [Scallion Pancakes](https://altonbrown.com/recipes/scallion-pancakes/) (the scallion oil).

The Broccoli & Tofu was from nowhere specifically; the sauce was black vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, corn starch, water, shaoxing cooking wine and sugar.
