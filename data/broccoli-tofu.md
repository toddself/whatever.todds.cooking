## Broccoli & Tofu, Scallion Pancakes, rice

Tonight's dinner was Broccoli & Tofu with rice and some scallion pancakes. The pancakes are mix-up of [The Flakiest Scallion Pancakes](https://www.seriouseats.com/recipes/2011/04/extra-flaky-scallion-pancakes-recipe.html) from J. Kenji Lopez-Alt (the dough & double roll technique) and Alton Brown's [Scallion Pancakes](https://altonbrown.com/recipes/scallion-pancakes/) (the scallion oil).

The Broccoli & Tofu was from nowhere specifically; the sauce was black vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, corn starch, water, shaoxing cooking wine and sugar. I cut the tofu in half and let it sit wrapped in a kitchen towel in the fridge with some weight on it to get it drier. Then I lightly dusted it with cornstarch, and cooked it in the wok first, getting it crispy-ish.  Then I took it out, added the broccoli and ilet it get some color. Then added some ginger, garlic and onions.  Then poured in the sauce, and added the tofu back.  Then we ate.

This is how I make rice. I'm lazy.
